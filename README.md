<h1>About me 👋</h1><br>
Hi, my name is Gopi. Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself.  In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.<br>

<h1>My experience 🏢</h1><br>
Over the past 7 months at Elsner Technologies, I’ve gained hands-on experience in manual testing, creating test cases, and tracking bugs through Jira. I’ve worked closely with the team to ensure everything runs smoothly and is bug-free. I’ve also started exploring test automation with Selenium to improve efficiency. My goal is to keep learning and improving while ensuring the highest quality for every product I test.<br>
